## App Description ##
Reserve allows users to search for rooms to reserve on Cornell's Central, West, North, and East campuses. Users can select a room and access information such as its capacity and images of the room if available. Users can perform a mock 1 hour booking of a room using our intuitive reservation process. Users can favorite their favorite rooms and view them in a separate tab. Users can view their current bookings in the bookings tab.
